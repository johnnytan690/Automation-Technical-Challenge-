**1.Instructions to Run the Tests**
Prerequisites:
Install Java JDK 8 or higher.

Install Maven (or Gradle) for dependency management.

Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) and ensure it is in your system's PATH.


Steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-management-tests-java.git

cd todo-management-tests-java

Run the tests using Maven:
bash
Copy
mvn clean test

**2.Implementation Strategy Overview**
Framework:
Programming Language: Java

Test Framework: TestNG (or JUnit)

Browser Automation: Selenium WebDriver

Build Tool: Maven

Test Structure:
Each acceptance criterion is mapped to a separate test method.

Test data is parameterized using TestNG's @DataProvider.

Assertions are performed using TestNG's Assert class.


**3. Running the Tests**
Ensure the WebDriver executable (e.g., chromedriver) is in your system's PATH.

Run the tests using Maven:
mvn clean test
